- **Copyright**: Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- **Derived modules**:
  - `@hy-sde-org/dsh-tool-codebase-memory` — ported from
    `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-codebase-memory` (the model-facing `codebase_*` CLI
    tools over `codebase-memory-mcp cli --json <tool>`, its MCP result-envelope
    parser, `codebase:tools` prompt section, and `invariant`/`cli-check`
    companions).

No other third-party code is vendored or bundled in this repository. Runtime
dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/cordis`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-invariants`,
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-system-prompt`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`) are consumed from
the npm registry under their own licenses.
